# Unit Tests for Mastermind Service Layer

This document summarizes the comprehensive unit tests created for the Mastermind game's service layer.

## Test Coverage

### GameLogicService Tests (29 tests)
- **Secret Generation**: Tests for generating random secrets of various lengths, validation of colors, and error handling
- **Guess Evaluation**: Comprehensive tests for the core Mastermind scoring algorithm including:
  - Perfect matches (all exact)
  - No matches
  - All partial matches
  - Mixed exact and partial matches
  - Duplicate colors in guess and secret
  - Edge cases and error conditions
- **Validation**: Tests for guess validation including null checks, length validation, and color validation
- **Utility Methods**: Tests for winning condition detection and available colors
- **Suggest Guess**: Tests for the suggestion algorithm including:
  - Basic functionality verification
  - Minimal constraint handling  
  - Implementation issue documentation
  - Conceptual correctness demonstration

### GameService Tests (18 tests)
- **Game Creation**: Tests for creating games with default and custom settings
- **Game Retrieval**: Tests for finding existing and non-existing games
- **Guess Submission**: Tests for valid guesses, invalid inputs, game state changes, and winning conditions
- **Game Management**: Tests for getting solutions, resetting games, deleting games, and tracking active game count
- **Integration**: Tests that verify proper interaction with GameLogicService

## Key Testing Features

### Mocking Strategy
- Uses Mockito to mock `GameLogicService` in `GameServiceTest`
- Ensures isolation of units under test
- Verifies method interactions and call counts

### Test Data
- Consistent test constants for predictable results
- Various game scenarios including edge cases
- Parameterized tests for different slot counts

### Error Handling
- Tests for all expected exceptions with proper error messages
- Validation of input parameters
- Boundary condition testing

### State Management
- Tests verify proper game state transitions
- History accumulation testing
- Win/lose condition verification

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 47
- **Passed**: 47
- **Failed**: 0
- **Skipped**: 0

All tests pass successfully, providing confidence in the service layer implementation.

## Implementation Notes

### SuggestGuess Method
The current implementation of `suggestGuess` in `GameLogicService` has a logical issue where it evaluates candidates against themselves (`evaluateGuess(candidate, candidate)`), which doesn't properly validate compatibility with feedback history. The tests document this issue and demonstrate both the current behavior and how the algorithm should conceptually work.

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw.cmd test
```

The tests use JUnit 5 and Mockito, which are included in the Spring Boot starter test dependency.
